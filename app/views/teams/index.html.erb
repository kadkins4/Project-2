      <h5>Learn Heroes</h5>
      <p>
      There are 113 heroes in DOTA 2.  Each hero has a unique set of 3-6 abilities, a large set of individual attributes (movement speed, base damage, range, etc.) It is crucial to have AT LEAST a basic understanding of what each hero in a game can do, and not just the skills but those lesser known attributes.  This app will help you learn on the fly, to help you climb the MMR ladder or just have more fun.

        <p><small>This hero, Puck, is my all time favorite.  Primarily a mid-lane hero, Puck is a great initiator and takes A LOT of skill and fast reactions, in conjunction with planning/foresight, to be effective. If you are new to the game, avoid playing this hero.</small></p>
