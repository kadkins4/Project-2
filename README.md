# DOTA2HUB

## Why D2H
DOTA (Defense of the Ancients) 2 is a MMOBA (Massively Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) which is a fancy way of saying an online game where players fight each other to win a game.  It's a 5v5 team game that requires teamwork, quick reflexes, strategy, and patience/tolerance/no nearby throwable items IRL.

Because of the competitive nature of this game the DOTA 2 Community (players, spectators, etc) can be extremely... volatile or extremely friendly (depending on the day).  This is especially noted by new players or players who are striving to improve greatly (and may be out of their skill bracket, MMR - Rating).  To help bring the community closer together and make the game more "noob" friendly (there is a lot of push back against VALVE - the devs - to NOT make the game easier to pick up, I am one of these people, as it will take away from the competitive nature). Instead we vie for the community itself to build out ways to 'welcome' the new players and ease the pain of losing 10+ games in a row - kappa.

This guide is meant to provide new players the ability to get an overview of heroes (114) and their abilities/attributes.  Without at least a little knowledge of what each hero does, you are sure to lose once you play against or with each.  In addition to helping new players, this is meant to break down more advanced information (in the future), that will help those players who are trying to get from 2.5k bracket to let's say 4k.

## Planning
![Trello Board](/app/assets/images/trello_board.png)

![ERD] (/app/assets/images/ERD.png)

- **MVP:** HEROES & TEAMS (Radiant & Dire) - this would lay the ground work for drafting sync where hopefully in a later iteration, I can link to STEAM and update as players are drafting in Captain's Mode or All Pick, giving players details in Real Time.  As for now, a small pool of heroes have basic tips and profiles.

- **USERS & COMMENTS:** Create a forum like atmosphere for tips, comments, advice, and an overall better/less troll'y place than Reddit/Dota2.

- **SKILLS:** Introduce all hero skills, scaling, etc.

- **TALENTS:** Introduce talent tree

- **ATTRIBUTES:** Introduce all hero base attributes

- **GAINS:** Attribute increase/level

- **LOGIC BETWEEN ATTRIBUTES & GAINS:** Combine it all!

- **ITEMS:** Items List and possibly a list of NEVER BUY for HERO.

- **STEAM/DOTA LINK:** self explanatory
